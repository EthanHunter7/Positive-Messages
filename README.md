# Positive Messages 
This project is a Codecademy project. I was given a task to use JavaScript to randomly generate a message. I decided to do positive messages because it is also good to try and spread positivity. The task was only to use JavaScript to randomly generate these messages, but I decided to make a webpage where it would so you a positive message and you could come back if you needed to and click for a positive message.

This is my first JavaScript project.
